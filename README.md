## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Data Storage**: Browser localStorage (no backend database required!)
- **Mobile Apps**: Capacitor for native Android and iOS builds

### Backend
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for wallet operations
- **XRPL Integration**: xrpl JavaScript library with custom connection management

### Hardware Wallet Integration
- **SDK**: @keystonehq/keystone-sdk
- **QR Codes**: @ngraveio/bc-ur for multi-part animated QR codes
- **Camera**: qr-scanner for QR code reading
- **Encoding**: ripple-binary-codec for transaction serialization

## Architecture Highlights

### WebSocket Connections
All XRPL communication uses WebSocket connections for real-time updates and reliable connectivity.

### Full-History Server Strategy
Ensures complete transaction history with intelligent fallback:
1. Try custom full-history endpoint (if configured)
2. Fall back to default full-history server
3. Final fallback to primary endpoint if needed

### Per-Wallet Network Configuration
Each wallet maintains its own network setting (Mainnet/Testnet), enabling:
- Multiple wallets on different networks simultaneously
- Independent custom node configuration per wallet
- Network-specific transaction history and balance tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Keystone 3 Pro hardware wallet (required for transaction signing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/justinnevins/dexrp-tools.git
cd dexrp-tools
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the provided local URL

### Configuration

#### Custom XRPL Nodes
Configure custom XRPL endpoints in Settings:
- **Mainnet Node**: Your preferred mainnet WebSocket endpoint
- **Testnet Node**: Your preferred testnet WebSocket endpoint
- **Full-History Servers**: Optional dedicated servers for complete transaction history

#### Default Endpoints
- **Mainnet**: wss://xrplcluster.com
- **Testnet**: wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233
- **Mainnet Full-History**: wss://s1.ripple.com:51234
- **Testnet Full-History**: wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51234

## Usage

### Adding Accounts
1. Navigate to Accounts & Settings (Profile page)
2. Click the + button in the XRPL Accounts section
3. Choose one of two options:
   - **Connect Keystone 3 Pro**: Scan your hardware wallet and select network (Mainnet/Testnet)
   - **Watch-Only Address**: Enter any XRPL address to monitor without signing capability

### Sending Transactions (Hardware Wallets Only)
1. Go to Wallet tab
2. Click "Send"
3. Enter destination address and amount
4. Use percentage buttons for quick amount selection
5. Scan the transaction QR code with your Keystone 3 Pro
6. Sign the transaction on your hardware wallet
7. Scan the signed QR code back into the app
8. Transaction is submitted to your configured XRPL node

### Managing Tokens (Hardware Wallets Only)
1. Navigate to Tokens tab
2. View existing trustlines and balances
3. Add new trustlines by currency code and issuer
4. Remove unwanted trustlines (requires QR signing)

### DEX Trading (Hardware Wallets Only)
1. Go to DEX tab
2. Select your trading pair currencies
3. Enter offer amount and price
4. Sign with Keystone 3 Pro via QR code
5. Monitor offer status in transaction history

### Viewing Watch-Only Accounts
1. Select a watch-only wallet from the account switcher
2. View real-time balance and transaction history
3. Track token holdings and trustlines
4. Access same information as hardware wallets, but without signing capability

## Security Features

- **Air-Gapped Signing**: All transactions signed offline on hardware wallet
- **No Private Key Exposure**: Keys never leave the Keystone device
- **Client-Side Storage**: Wallet data stored locally, not on servers
- **Custom Node Support**: Connect to your own trusted XRPL validators
- **Protocol Verification**: Transaction details displayed for verification before signing
- **Watch-Only Protection**: Multiple layers prevent accidental signing with watch-only addresses
