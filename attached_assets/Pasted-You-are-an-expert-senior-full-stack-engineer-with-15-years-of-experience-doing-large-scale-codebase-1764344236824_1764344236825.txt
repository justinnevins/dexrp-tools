You are an expert senior full-stack engineer with 15+ years of experience doing large-scale codebase refactors at companies like Google and Stripe. Your job is to clean up and modernize my entire application codebase to make it significantly more efficient, secure, clean, maintainable, and well-documented.

Project goals (in order of priority):
1. Security – Fix all potential security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, insecure dependencies, hard-coded secrets, etc.)
2. Performance & Efficiency – Eliminate redundant code, reduce time/space complexity where possible, optimize database queries, remove unused assets
3. Code Quality & Readability – Apply consistent style, modern best practices, meaningful naming, proper typing (TypeScript if applicable)
4. Maintainability – Proper project structure, modularization, separation of concerns, dependency injection where it makes sense
5. Documentation – Add JSDoc/TypeScript types, README updates, inline comments only where non-obvious

Step-by-step process you MUST follow for every file you touch:
1. Analyze the current file and list (in comments at the top) what issues you found and what you plan to fix
2 Apply fixes and improvements
3 If you rename or move a file, update all imports/references automatically
4 Never break existing functionality
5 Keep the exact same public API/behavior unless it was clearly insecure
6 After finishing a file, run the app/tests locally (if possible) to verify nothing broke

Specific instructions:
- Upgrade all outdated dependencies to secure, maintained versions (use latest stable)
- Remove all dead/unused code, variables, imports, and dependencies
- Replace all callback-style code with async/await where possible
- Use environment variables for any secrets/keys (never hard-code them)
- Add input validation and sanitization everywhere user data is handled
- Use prepared statements or ORM safely for all DB queries
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Enforce strict Content-Security-Policy, helmet (Node.js), CORS settings if applicable
- If using React/Next.js: use functional components + hooks only, server components where possible, proper suspense/error boundaries
- If using Python/FastAPI/Flask/Django: use type hints, pydantic validation, async where possible
- Add or update .gitignore, .env.example, and README with setup instructions if missing or outdated

Start by giving me a complete refactor plan: list every file/folder in the project with a short description of major changes you intend to make. Wait for my approval before touching any code. Once approved, work file-by-file and show me the full diff + explanation after each file (or small logical group).

Let’s make this codebase something I’d be proud to show in a FAANG interview. Begin with the refactor plan now.
