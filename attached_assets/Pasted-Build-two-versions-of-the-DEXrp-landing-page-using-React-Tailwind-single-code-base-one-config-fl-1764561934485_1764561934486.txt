Build two versions of the DEXrp landing page using React + Tailwind (single code base, one config flag).

Product truth (never deviate from this):
- DEXrp is a watch-only interface for the XRP Ledger.
- All private keys and signing happen exclusively on the air-gapped Keystone 3 Pro hardware wallet.
- The workflow is fully air-gapped (QR → Keystone → QR).
- Current only supported air-gapped device = Keystone 3 Pro.
- Future devices will be added only when the community strongly requests them.

Version 1 – Public website[](https://dexrp.me) – shown to everyone
Version 2 – In-app “About / Home” screen loaded inside the Capacitor Android build – shown only to mobile users (hide upsells and pricing for paying users).

Use an env flag `IS_MOBILE_APP=true/false` to switch between the two.

Required Structure & Exact Wording (copy verbatim where marked):

1. Hero Section (both versions)
   Headline: “DEXrp – Fully Air-Gapped XRPL Wallet for Keystone 3 Pro”
   Subheadline (exact):  
   “Watch-only interface. Private keys never leave your Keystone.  
   Sign payments, trustlines, and DEX trades completely offline via QR.”

   CTAs (public site only):
   - Primary: “Launch Free Web App” → opens the PWA
   - Secondary: “Get Premium Mobile – $9.99 one-time” → Google Play or purchase flow

   CTAs (mobile in-app version):  
   - Similar to current landing page but very stripped down
   - No pricing, no upsell

2. Accuracy Callout (both versions, small badge under hero)
   “100% air-gapped signing — Keystone 3 Pro never touches the internet.”

3. Feature Grid (both versions)
   - Air-Gapped Signing with Keystone 3 Pro (Free)
   - Custom XRPL Node Selection (Free)
   - Payments & Trustlines (Free)
   - Basic DEX Trading (Free)
   - Advanced DEX Tools (limit orders, slippage guard, multi-hop) → Premium
   - Portfolio Analytics & Tax Export → Premium
   - Priority Private Nodes → Premium
   - Batch & Template Signing → Premium

   On mobile in-app version: show Premium features as unlocked (green check) with no price tags.

4. Open-Source & Community Section (both versions)
   Title: “Open-Source Core. Community-Driven Future.”
   Text (exact):
   “The entire watch-only interface and QR signing flow are 100% open-source on GitHub.
   Keystone 3 Pro is fully supported today.
   Want another QR-based cold wallet? Tell us — we’ll build the ones the community actually needs.”

   Buttons:
   - “View Source on GitHub”
   - “Request Your Wallet → GitHub Discussions”

5. Pricing Table – PUBLIC SITE ONLY
   When IS_MOBILE_APP=true → completely hide this section.

   | Tier            | Price           | Includes                                      |
   |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
   | Free Web App    | Forever free    | Full Keystone air-gapped workflow + basics   |
   | Premium Mobile  | $9.99 one-time  | All pro features + priority updates          |

   Small note: “One-time purchase = lifetime access & updates”
